Starting from the base, it shows 'Species' followed by 'Genus,' 'Family,' 'Order,' 'Class,' 'Phylum or Division,' and finally 'Kingdom' at the top. Each category is connected by an upward-pointing arrow, indicating the increasing level of generality or inclusiveness as one moves up the hierarchy. This diagram visually represents how organisms are classified into increasingly broader groups based on their shared characteristics.",
